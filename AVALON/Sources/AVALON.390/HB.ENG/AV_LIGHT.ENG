AV_LIGHT.PRG
============

AVALON-Light is a special version of AVALON. Some functions have been
removed to make more memory available for applications like LED. I hope
thats enough for points with only one megbyte...

Following functions have been removed:

 - Terminal
 - Filemanager
 - File hatcher/ticker (F'Hatch)
 - "!xxx"-commands in batchinterpreter
 - Notebook
 - Windowpositions will not be saved
 - "N/P" in "Edit areas"
