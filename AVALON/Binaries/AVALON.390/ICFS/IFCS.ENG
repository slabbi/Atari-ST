                   Documentation to ICFS.CPX  V 1.13

============================================================================
A very beautiful good morning (and may there be many more)!

This documentation pre-supposes a working knowledge of ICFS. If you're not 
familiar with ICFS I suggest you read the ICFS documentation first.

A brief reminder:  ICFS installs a Cookie which programs can call to 
accomplish the Iconification of windows (even without MultiTOS!). The icons 
don't take up much space on the screen and offers a very practical 
alternative to having many open windows on screen at the same time.

As that also be, in any case gives it the possibility, which place to leave
iconification windows after taste;  also the size is selectable.

All these options can be comfortably managed using this CPX.


Installation:
-------------
Copy the file ICFS.CPX into the folder where your other CPXs reside.
What's a CPX? Hmmn, where have you been for the last couple of years!
CPXs are modular utilities for use with the new Atari Control Panel 
'XCONTROL.ACC'. So that's the installation complete. Now reboot your 
computer or reload the modules into XCONTROL and the ICFS CPX should appear 
ready for use.


Using ICFS:
-----------
My old teacher used to say 'Now, what can we see if we open the CPX?' and I 
would like to agree with him on this occasion.

So, what can we see?

- Start corner:
---------------
A white rectangle, a quarter of which is displayed inverted. The inverted 
quadrant indicates the start corner for iconified windows. By default this 
is the lower left hand corner. To change the starting corner simply click 
on another quadrant. So if you fancy the icons starting at the bottom right 
hand corner please go right ahead.


- Direction:
------------
Two options are available 'Horizontal' and 'Vertical'. By default the 
'Horizontal' option is active so iconified windows will be stacked 
adjacent to each other horizontally.

Example: If you've selected the bottom left hand 
corner as the start corner with 'Vertical' alignment ICFS will stack the 
iconified windows, from left to right across the bottom of the screen.

- Release:
----------
Selecting the button 'Start' displays an alert box checking this is your
intended action.

If you select 'OK' at the alert box all the icon positions are released 
again and ICFS restarts with the preset start corner.


- Size):
--------
This option features a Pop-up from which the icon size from five different 
sizes can be selected: 

64 x 64
72 x 72
80 x 80
88 x 88
96 x 96

Something for everybody hopefully!


- Distance:
-----------
Only available if v0.11 of ICFS is installed

A Pop-up appears from which you can select the distance between ICFS 
windows. The following options are available:

0   pixels
4   pixels
8   pixels
12  pixels
16  pixels


- OK:
-----
Each CPX contains a master button which closes the module and says goodbye, 
until it's called up again.  All selected options remain active.


- Cancel:
---------
Each CPX contains a Cancel option which also closes the module but in this 
case any options selected are ignored and returned to the settings before 
the CPX was called.

Important!
----------
The 'Cancel' option cannot undo the 'Release' option which is why this 
option comes equipped with its own alert box.


- Save:
-------
Once you've settled on your favourite settings use the 'Save' option to 
store your settings in the CPX. These settings will remain active until you 
change them again even after a reboot. An alert box appears offering you a 
last chance to change your mind.

So that's that. I'd better point out the fact that CPXs generally still 
cannot be assigned keyboard shortcuts. The one exception is the default 
option surrounded by a bold outline which can be selected using the 
[Return] key but all Atari users knew that already so I won't mention it!
 

In conclusion I'll add the following:
-------------------------------------
I take no responsibility whatever for any damage caused by using the CPX, 
you use it at your own risk.

ICFS is Freeware and may be distributed freely however I retain the 
Copyright which means you may not change ICFS.

I must point out that ICFS was not my Idea! Originally it came from Reiner 
Rosin, using ICFS in Zeig's mir. The server (the ICFS.PRG in your AUTO 
folder) was done by Dirk Haun!
