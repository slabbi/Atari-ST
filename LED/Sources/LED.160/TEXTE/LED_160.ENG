5D support / network-dependant netmail areas

  As from version 1.50 it is possible to define more than one netmail 
  area in LED: mark the desired area with "-Netmail <domain>" in the 
  AREAS.BBS file. The <domain> MUST be the full network name, i.e. 
  fidonet.org, nest.ftn, atarinet.ftn etc.
  The FIRST area in AREAS.BBS continues to be the main netmail area. 
  It may be redefined using "-Netmail <domain>" but will ALWAYS be 
  treated as a netmail area (both with and without this statement).

 These are the other changes to LED:

  o In the user lists all entries should now be in 5D format, i.e. with
    domain. Searching for a name in the user list will only produce members
    of the current domain.
    If this is not specified in the user list, the name will be presented
    anyway as it may possibly belong to the current network.

    However, it is possible to specify a default domain for ALL names of a
    user list that have NO domain specification. This domain may be defined
    for each user list using the menu "Options->Userlist".
    So, for a NeST user list you would rather specify "nest.ftn" as the
    default domain than adding the domain to EACH entry.

  o "Add PRVTUSER.LST" will now attempt to add domain information to the
    new entry in the user list. The methods used are:
    a) For a network-dependant netmail the domain as specified in the
       "-Netmail <domain>" statement will be added.
    b) For an echomail the domain of the first link will be used.
    c) For the main netmail area NO domain will be added yet (edit this
       manually).

  o The dialog boxes "Search in Userlist" and "Forward msg" are not domain
    aware yet.
    Example:
    If you click on the "To:" line while editing a mail a dialog box
    appears. Searching for a name will search ALL user lists and will
    produce ALL matching names as a domain specification is not possible
    here yet.

Resource- and Languagefile:

  From version 1.41 LED makes use of a resource- AND a languagefile.
  The resourcefile (LED.RSC) must be placed in the LED systemfolder or
  in the same folder together with LED.PRG; the languagefile (*.LNG) must
  be placed in the LED systemfolder.

  When you have written a new language adaptation please send it to
  LED-HQ.

Files:

  Following files are used by LED:

  Filename    Desciption               Optional   Editable

    LED.CFG   Configurationfile           Yes       Yes
    LED.DLG   Dialogpositions             Yes        No

    LED.LNG   Languagefiles                No       Yes
    LED.LOG   Logfile (for errors)        Yes       Yes (Why?)

    LED.OPT   Setup (Options)             Yes        No
    LED.PRG   Programfile                  No        No
    LED.PRN   Printerdriver (binary)      Yes        No
    LED.RSC   Resourcefile                 No       Yes (RSC-Editor)
    LED.RSD   Definitionfile for RSC       --       Yes (RSC-Editor)
    LED.SCT   Shortcutfile                Yes       Yes
    LED.NIC   Nicknames                   Yes       Yes
      *.PN    Printerdriver (source)       --       Yes

Charset conversion:

  LED 1.29 can display other character sets correctly when the mail
  contains a CHRS or CHARSET kludge. Note: LED converts Latin-1 codes
  into the ST font and not into the IBMPC font! The converter uses a
  best match table that means that not existing Latin-1 characters are
  converted into similar ST characters.

  Be carefull when quoting such a mail: When saving a mail with a
  converted Latin-1 font LED creates a "^CHRS IBMPC 2" kludge (normally
  it should write "ATARIST" instead of "IBMPC" but that is not defined).
  Some converted Latin-1 characters do not exist in the IBMPC font, so
  the receiver of the msg might see some block graphics.
  When you have installed an IBMPC font (like Myblue) you will be able
  to see how the mail looks like on the receiver's system.

  LED can display msgs with MIME coded characters. Such mails cannot be
  recognized automatically so this feature is switchable with ALT+1
  (Options->Switches->Convert MIME style). When this feature is enabled
  LED does use the LATIN1->Atari-ST convertion, too, when no valid
  ^CHRS kludge defines another convertion method.

Important note:

  "Address correction" (and the flag "Fixed address") is not needed
  as a rule! Especially points or nodes with only one address per zone/
  network will NEVER need to make use of this feature!
  Every tosser known to me (JetMail, IOSmail, Ecu/Llegada) normally
  ignores the entries LED makes and enters it's own address of sender.
  Nevertheless, if you have several addresses within a zone/network, you
  could only use one fixed address until now. This concerned e.g. Z*C's,
  R*C's N*C's and other's with administrative addresses. "Address
  correction" now enables them to choose their address as desired and
  instruct their tosser (atm JetMail only) via the flag "Fixed address"
  not to alter that (origin) address at export.

  In echo areas the address correction can be switched on using the
  statement "-FixedAddress". Note: LED only writes the origin address!
  The routing (the destination address) must be done by the tosser!
  When quoting from such an area into the netmail (and "Address
  correction" for netmail not selected) LED creates no MSGID and origin
  address. That must be done by the tossser as usual.

  I.e.: points and nodes with only one address per zone can do without.
  The other's must decide for themselves whether they need this feature
  or not...

Another important note:

  Now you MUST define your netmail as FIRST area in AREAS.BBS. The
  config statement "NETMAIL" is not longer parsed by the LED 1.26
  (and higher).

ACS-Package:

  In LED 1.28 (and higher) you MUST define the ExtraExportArea and
  Bad_Msgs in the AREAS.BBS, otherwise LED does not show them.
  The "EchoList" for ACS will be created as usual when you put the
  'ECHOLIST' statement in LED.CFG.

NVDI 2.5x bug:

  When using NVDI 2.5x (not NVDI 2.5x ET4000) the scollbar in the
  AreaListWindow is not drawn.

Support-Echos:

  Information of new LED versions will be given in following echos:
  ST_FIDO.GER (FidoNet), N.SUP.LED (NeST) and A.SUP.LED (AtariNet).
  If you have questions about the new LED please write them in one
  of these echos or use the netmail!

ToDo-List:

  Please send me your ideas how to improve LED (btw the ToDo list is
  approx. 60kb long now => over 140 different suggestions ;-)).

 |   - and much more improvments                               |||
 | - 12 userlists available now.                               |||
 | - "Switches->Recognize AkaSysop":                           |||
 |   Disabled: LED displays "<" and ">", when the sender/      |||
 |             receiver of a msg is equal to the sysop in the  |||
 |             first characters. This is the behaviour of LED  |||
 |             until version 1.45.                             |||
 |    Enabled: LED displays "<" and ">", when the sender/      |||
 |             receiver of a msg is 100% equal to one of the   |||
 |             definied AkaSYSOPs. Also LED recognizes the     |||
 |             first 20 "-Pseudonym <name>" and "-Name <name>" |||
 |             statements in AREAS.BBS. When this function is  |||
 |             enabled LED is slowed down a little bit.        |||
 | - Shift+Cntrl+L works again.                                |||
 | - Quoting changed:                                          |||
 |   CNTRL+[T|N|J] - Quote msg (as defined)                    |||
 |   SHIFT+[T|N|J] - Quote msg (switch to other language)      |||
 | - "Switches->Add infoline" prints msg with infoline.        |||
 | - "Shift+W" calls menu function "Write Binary". LED tries   |||
 |   to join splitted mails automatically! There is no         |||
 |   question if you want to continue with the next mail.      |||
 | - Nine AkaSysops are allowed now.                           |||
 | - Getting quote characters from strings like                |||
 |   "Stephan_Slabihoud@somewhere.de"                          |||
 |   works properly now.                                       |||
 | - "Switches->'ž' (ATARI-ST Font)"                           |||
 |   When this switch is enabled, LED uses ascii code 158 for  |||
 |   the 'ž' and creates a "CHRS: ATARIST 2" kludge.           |||
 |   Otherwise LED uses ascii code 225 for the 'ž' and creates |||
 |   a (compatible) "CHRS: IBMPC 2" kludge.                    |||
 |   Normally this switch should be DISABLED!                  |||
 | - LED was not able to unfreeze ST-GUIDE with MagiC 5.0. Now |||
 |   this should work even with MagiC 5.0 again.               |||
 | - The selection of reversed displayed text should be        |||
 |   correct now.                                              |||
 | - Seperate nicknames can be defined for each area. Here is  |||
 |   the new format of LED.NIC:                                |||
 |     <nickname>,<full name>[,<area>]                         |||
 | - "ChangeMsg" deletes a tearline also when a '%' parameter  |||
 |   is used in the first line of LED.FLN.                     |||
 |   Small bug removed that added a single line with a space   |||
 |   at the end of the text.                                   |||
 | - "CallExporter" is only executed when a new msg has been   |||
 |   created.                                                  |||
 |                                                             |||
 | - Recognition of (own) tearlines improved:                  |||
 |                                                             |||
 |   RandomFootlines are removed automatically when a msg is   |||
 |   changed with "Change msg". Please note:                   |||
 |    - RandomFootlines are only removed from the last eight   |||
 |      msg lines.                                             |||
 |    - The RandomFootline must start with exact the same      |||
 |      sequence defined in the corresponding RandomFootline-  |||
 |      File for this area (first line in this file=>PREFIX).  |||
 |      The minimum length of the sequence are two characters  |||
 |      (without '|' line wraps).                              |||
 |    - Between the PREFIX and the textline no empty line      |||
 |      should appear! So use a maximum of ONE '|' at the end  |||
 |      of the prefix!                                         |||
 |    - The LOCAL flag must be set.                            |||
 |                                                             |||

 | - You can define about 100 nicknames. To do this you must   |||
 |   create a file called LED.NIC in LED's systemfolder. The   |||
 |   format of LED.NIC is very simple: First enter the         |||
 |   nickname, followed by a comma and then the full name.     |||
 |     <nickname>, <full name>                                 |||
 |   A comment line begins with a semikolon.                   |||
 |   You can use the nicknames with a '%'-parameter. '%i'      |||
 |   conforms with '%f' but uses the nickname instead of the   |||
 |   first name (when the nickname is defined) and '%I'        |||
 |   conforms with '%t'.                                       |||
 |   => ONLY FOR REGISTERED USER <=                            |||
 | - Pressing Shift+x sets the "Locked" flag in the MsgWindow. |||
 | - ALT+Mouseclick on a valid address works in the "To:" line |||
 |   in netmail area now!                                      |||

 |   It is possible to use a new folder format with            |||
 |   BinkleyTerm 3.18 (and above). LED uses this format when   |||
 |   the statement "Outbound36" is found in BINKLEY.CFG or     |||

 |   "CallExporter n" orders LED to send the message "Start    |||
 |   Exporter" to AVALON (n=0) or SEMPER (n=1) when LED exits. |||
 |   Avalon/Semper call the exporter automatically.            |||

 | - ALT+Mouseclick on a valid address displays all flags and  |||
 |   works in the "From:" line in netmail area now!            |||
 | - LED supports the 'FidoInfo' message (FIDO_MSG-Protocoll)  |||
 |   now. For more information: See DEVELOP folder.            |||
 | - Wrap function changed.                                    |||
 | - When a msg is aborted (using the Closer, Abort msg or     |||
 |   Cntrl+Z) a dialogbox appears now.                         |||
 |   To abort a msg immediatly press Shift+Cntrl+Z now.        |||
 | - A lot of code rewritten to make LED a little bit faster.  |||
 | - RandomFootlines are removed automatically when a msg is   |||
 |   changed with "Change msg". Please note:                   |||
 |    - RandomFootlines are only removed from the last eight   |||
 |      msg lines.                                             |||
 |    - The RandomFootline must start with exact the same      |||
 |      sequence defined in the corresponding RandomFootline-  |||
 |      File for this area (first line in this file). The      |||
 |      minimum length of the sequence are two characters.     |||
 |    - The LOCAL flag must be set.                            |||
 | - Msgs with text effects are shown a little bit faster.     |||
 | - "Write BINARY" decodes MIME coded msgs in "base64"        |||
 |   format now. The distinction between UUE and MIME is done  |||
 |   automatically.                                            |||

 | - "Keep" and "Forward" was selectable in ChangeAreaDialog.  |||
 | - "p" (NUM+1) and "n" (NUM+3) jumped also to deleted msgs.  |||
 | - In LED_ICON.RSC you will find icons for LED. ColorIcons   |||
 |   are not available because I have not a color monitor...   |||
 | - When LED is started as single task in MagiC, normally all |||
 |   accessories are disabled, that means ST-GUIDE cannot be   |||
 |   called. LED unfreezes this accessory when necessary now.  |||
 | - "Uucp" flag is displayed especially for Daron (Hi ;-)).   |||

 |   start ST-GUIDE as applikation. "ST-GUIDE.APP" must be     |||
 |   put in the LED systemfolder to use this feature.          |||
 | - "Shift+HELP" displays available keys.                     |||
 | - The zone-/node-number is not entered separately in        |||
 |   following dialogs now: SearchUser-, CarbonCopy- and       |||
 |   FRequest-Dialog.                                          |||

 |   more areas start with the same characters press TAB to    |||
 |   cycle between them. When you press TAB in the MsgWindow   |||
 |   the next area with the same characters will be selected   |||
 |   (even when the AreaListWindow is closed). The selection   |||
 |   will be lost when a new area is selected i.e. with one of |||

 |     5.) Repeat step 4.) to select other NeST areas          |||
 | - LED does also call LED.HYP in the EditWindow when the     |||
 |   cursor is on a whitespace and HELP is pressed.            |||
 | - The resourcefile (LED.RSC) can be placed in the LED-      |||
 |   systemfolder or in the same folder together with LED.PRG  |||
 |   LED searches first in the systemfolder for this file.     |||
 | - New flag "Multiple CC". When this flag is set JetMail     |||
 |   will create carbon copys when the mail is exported.       |||
 |   More information you will find in the JetMail dox.        |||

 |   the K/S flag now when the destination address is one of   |||
 |   your own.                                                 |||
 | - When clicking in the MsgWindow with pressed ALTERNATE key |||
 |   on an address, this address is searched in the nodelist   |||
 |   and information about the entry are displayed.            |||
 |   This function does only work when a nodelist is used!     |||
 | - When searching for a nodenumber in the userlist-dialog,   |||
 |   LED searches in the nodelist first and then in the        |||
 |   userlists.                                                |||
 | - "Hidden CC" implemented. A name will not be included in   |||
 |   the "CC:" list when a "-" is set in front of the name in  |||
 |   the CC dialog.                                            |||

 |   crash now.                                                |||
 | - The systemfile LED.SYS is not longer necessary because    |||
 |   a new headerfile format is not to be expected in future.  |||
 |   All functions have been reimplemented in the main program.|||
 | - A "-NoExport" area is marked with a "x" in the AreaList-  |||
 |   Window now. LED also warns you when trying to write a msg |||
 |   in a "NoExport"-echo.                                     |||
 | - Slider in MsgListWindow and AreaListWindow corrected. 128 |||
 |   characters are displayed now.                             |||
 | - New deadkey "|" implemented:                              |||
 |     a -> †  134  0x86          b -> ¦  166  0xa6            |||

 | - LED evaluates the keypad more precisely. When the keyboard|||
 |   has been remapped (e.g. by KeyEdit) LED should display    |||
 |   the correct character now. KeyEdit only returns a changed |||
 |   ascii-code but the scancode from the keypad. So LED 1.40  |||
 |   was not able to display the changed characters.           |||
 | - New keys:                                                 |||
 |     ALT+3: Recognize ^CHAR kludge (was ALT+7)               |||
 |     ALT+7: Show SEEN-BYs (New)                              |||
 |     ALT+8: Show Comment-Tree (was ALT+3)                    |||
 |     NUM+1: Previous unread msg                              |||
 |     NUM+3: Next unread msg                                  |||
 | - Bugfix: Selection in areadialog corrected.                |||
 | - "%"-statements can be used in the praefix of footlines    |||
 |   (first line in LED.FLN) now.                              |||
 | - Bugfix: Very long quoted lines can be quoted again without|||
 |   bombs!                                                    |||
 | - Bugfix: When selecting a word/filename the effect-        |||
 |   indicator should work as described.                       |||
 | - LED makes use of a language file now (LED.LNG). So it is  |||
 |   possible to adapt (together with LED.RSC) LED to every    |||
 |   language you want. The language file must be put in the   |||
 |   systemfolder.                                             |||
 | - Realtimescrolling (MagiC 4.0) does not flicker.           |||
 | - And again some small bugfixes.                            |||
 | - I am sorry but there was a small bug in the english       |||
 |   update hypertext ("What's new in...->1.40").              |||
 |                                                             |||

 | - LED can display msgs with MIME coded characters now. Such |||
 |   mails cannot be recognized automatically so this feature  |||
 |   is switchable with ALT+1 (Options->Switches->Convert MIME |||
 |   style). When this feature is enabled LED does use the     |||
 |   LATIN1->Atari-ST convertion, too, when no valid ^CHRS     |||
 |   kludge defines another convertion method.                 |||
 |   Infoline displays:                                        |||

 | - When clicking on a word with the CONTROL-key pressed LED  |||
 |   searches the word in the shortcut-file (LED.SCT) and      |||
 |   displays all entries found.                               |||
 | - New help feature available with CONTROL-F4 in "MsgWindow" |||
 |   and "EditWindow". This needs 2kb of code. Please tell me  |||
 |   if it is usefull or not. If it is useless I will remove   |||
 |   it in the next version.                                   |||
 | - "Options->Comment->Complete msgbase scan" allows to build |||
 |   a correct comment-tree even when a reply is found before  |||
 |   the original msg. Note: This slows LED down a little bit  |||
 |   and is (normally) not neccessary!                         |||
 | - "Switches->Numblock graphics" removed. Now you can use    |||
 |   following feature in the EditWindow:                      |||
 |     ALT+NUMPAD <n> = Enter ASCII-Code                       |||
 |   SHIFT+NUMPAD <n> = Blockgraphics                          |||
 |   CNTRL+NUMPAD <n> = Blockgraphics                          |||
 | - "Cntrl+F3" kills all msgs.                                |||
 | - Shortcut (Cntrl+F1) function improved. Now you can use    |||
 |   the "%"-shortcuts (incl. function keys) that are allowed  |||
 |   in toplines in files that are defined with                |||
 |     - <name>, <filename>                                    |||
 | - When ALT+RETURN is pressed LED asks if you want to delete |||
 |   all msgs with the same subject or all msgs written by the |||
 |   same person.                                              |||
 | - When selecting a word in the MsgWindow LED asks if this   |||
 |   should be requestet as file or searched in the hypertexts.|||
 | - "Delete quote stuff..." with "Delete" as default.         |||
 | - Big bug fixed: LED crashed sometimes when an empty area   |||
 |   and the MsgListWindow was open at the same time.          |||
 | - New Quote/FKey parameter "%v" contains LED's version      |||
 |   number.                                                   |||
 | - "Carbon-Copy" allows to merge CCL files (select LOAD and  |||
 |   then choose MERGE).                                       |||
 | - "Carbon-Copy" dialog a little bit improved.               |||
 | - "File->Read BINARY" reads a binary file uue-coded into    |||
 |   a msg.                                                    |||
 |   "File->Write BINARY" saves a uue-coded mail into a file.  |||
 |   NOTE: LED does not support splitting on purpose, otherwise|||
 |   the mail traffic will (IMO) become enormous because user  |||
 |   will send their whole filebase. Splitted uue-coded mails  |||
 |   can be written by LED when these mails are stored in the  |||
 |   correct order.                                            |||
 |   NOTE: The ESS-CODER by Michel Forget has two small bugs:  |||
 |           1.It appends an extra character to each line      |||
 |           2.The line before the "end" consists of a space   |||
 |             and a character (1.bug). An encoder should write|||
 |             zero bytes when it founds such a line.          |||
 |   Even if this behaviour is not correct LED works correct.  |||
 | - FIDOCONFDIR does not work properly when the path ends     |||
 |   with a '\'.                                               |||
 | - Because of some LED user who do not understand what       |||
 |   "shareware" means, I have implemented another (new)       |||
 |   reminder-dialog in LED. Perhaps only registered user will |||
 |   be able to use further versions in future.                |||
 | - Some minor bugfixes.                                      |||
 | - Selecting files in a msg works properly now even when     |||
 |   texteffects are used in that line.                        |||
 | - Bugfix: LED used the last entered command line for a      |||
 |   program started with "Execute".                           |||
 | - When starting a "*.GTP" program LED asked for a command   |||
 |   line now.                                                 |||
 | - "Search in userlist" searches for addresses again.        |||
 | - LED shows no texteffects in the To-line now.              |||
 | - System-Report improved.                                   |||
 | - LED has not recognized the october in the "%z" parameter. |||
 |                                                             |||

 |   Because of a new texteffect ('#' = inverse text) the      |||
 |   printertable entries 0x10 (16d) up to 0x17 (23d) have     |||
 |   been changed.                                             |||

 |   LED 1.31 is also available in a "light" version. The only |||
 |   difference between the full-version and LEDlight is:      |||
 |     - approx.200 kb less memory usage                       |||
 |     - no Area- and MsgListeWindow avaiable                  |||
 |     - Headersorting not possible                            |||
 |     - max.3000 msgs per area                                |||
 |     - max.3000 lines per msg                                |||

 | - "...special flags" in the menubar allows to edit the      |||
 |   "Precessed" field in the msg header.                      |||
 | - "No compression" creates sometimes the "No more lines"    |||
 |   bug.                                                      |||
 | - Bugfix: When writing to the same person using different   |||
 |   addresses LED has used the wrong address.                 |||
 | - Searching for addresses in the CC dialog works again now. |||
 | - Small problem removed with the redraw of the infoline in  |||
 |   the MsgWindow.                                            |||
 | - "WM_ONTOP" sets LED's menubar when MagiC is installed.    |||
 | - NEWECHOS.LST will be written even when you have started   |||
 |   a program with "Execute".                                 |||
 | - Texteffect "'#'=Inverse text" implemented.                |||
 | - Continuous reading of mails with SPACE did not work in    |||
 |   1.31b.                                                    |||
 | - Maximum length of RandomTearlines: 1024 characters now!   |||
 |   You can use the same "%"-shortcuts in tearlines that are  |||
 |   allowed in toplines.                                      |||
 | - Tiny problems in the MsgListDialog fixed.                 |||
 | - It is allowed to use trailing spaces in the first line of |||

 |   LED expects to find most of it's files in a folder        |||

 |        This defines the path AND name(!) of the             |||

 |          LED=D:\FIDOSOFT\CONFIGS\LED                        |||
 |     2. Defined by the environment "FIDOCONFDIR":            |||
 |        LED expects its configuration folder (called "LED")  |||

 |     3. When $FIDOCONFDIR does not exist, LED tries to find  |||
 |        its config folder in .\CONFIG                        |||
 |     4. Folder defined by environment "BINKLEY"              |||

 |     6. Home directory of LED.PRG                            |||
 |   LED searches in those folders for following files:        |||
 |     LED.NEW, BINKLEY.CFG, AREAS.BBS, ACS.CFG                |||
 |                                                             |||
 |   Follwing files are treated in an especially way:          |||
 |     LED.NEW : If this file is found in the LED folder, it   |||
 |               will be read from there only.                 |||
 |     LED.LOG : This (error) file will be created in the      |||
 |               LED folder unless the statement "Logfile"     |||
 |               in LED.CFG defines a different logfile.       |||
 |                                                             |||
 |  Note:                                                      |||
 |    BINKLEY.CFG is only neccessary when no LED.CFG is        |||
 |    used.                                                    |||

 | - Blockmarking and frequest selection by mouse should work  |||
 |   on each TOS version.                                      |||
 | - Bugfix: Msg selection by clicking in the (original)       |||
 |   GEM infoline of the MsgWindow works now when the          |||
 |   systemfont is not used in the MsgWindow                   |||
 | - "CNTRL+SHIFT+RETURN" (delete all msgs with same subject)  |||
 |   changed to "ALT+RETURN". It worked with MagiC but not     |||
 |   with plain TOS :-(                                        |||
 | - TB.CFG is not longer supported.                           |||
 | - BugFix: EPSON.PN and IBM.PN did not work.                 |||
 | - Uucp mails will not be quoted with "u>".                  |||
 | - Bad Bug in effect function removed.                       |||
 | - LED can create a system report (menubar->help->           |||
 |   system report). When you have problems with LED you       |||
 |   should send me this file (if neccessary).                 |||
 | - Only the first selected filename in the MsgWindow was     |||
 |   copied correctly into the FileRequestDialogue.            |||
 | - When LED detects quote lines at the end of a new written  |||
 |   mail it asks if these quotes should be deleted before     |||
 |   saving the mail.                                          |||
 | - LED word-wraped imported files now.                       |||
 | - <CNTRL>+<DEL> deletes one word                            |||
 |   <SHIFT>+<DEL> deletes one character with line wrap        |||
 |                 (was CNTRL+DEL)                             |||
 | - Mousepointer was hidden when calling a "MsgWindow"-macro  |||
 |   in the EditWindow.                                        |||
 | - "sF1" in menubar changed to "^F1".                        |||
 |                                                             |||

 | -IgnoreNewMsgFlag  LED ignores the "NeMsgFlag", so it shows |||
 |                    no "*" for this area.                    |||
 | -IgnoreUnreadFlag  LED ignores the "UnreadFlag", so it shows|||
 |                    no "/" for this area.                    |||
 | -RandomFootline    LED creates a random footline for that   |||
 |                    area taken from LED.FLN.                 |||
 | -NoRandomFootline  LED creates no random footline for that  |||
 |                    area.                                    |||
 | -FootlineFile <file> LED creates a random footline for that |||
 |                    area taken from <file> (same format as   |||
 |                    LED.FLN).                                |||

 |   LED needs a systemfile "LED.SYS" now. If this file is not |||
 |   found in the LED's configuration folder LED cannot be     |||
 |   started. The systemfile contains functions to access the  |||
 |   msgbase headerfile. When the headerfileformat changes you |||
 |   must only replace this file, not the complete LED. The    |||
 |   systemfile is stored in a compressed format.              |||
 |                                                             |||

 |   In this package you will find an english manual for       |||
 |   LED 1.30 now (MANUAL.ENG). I want to thank Antony Lacey   |||
 |   for his really good work on this manual.                  |||
 |                                                             |||
 | - Blockselection in EditWindow using the mouse:             |||
 |     1. Hold down right mousekey,                            |||
 |     2. Singleclick on left key: Blockstart                  |||
 |        Doubleclick "   "    " : Blockend                    |||
 | - It is possible to select filenames in the MsgWindow now   |||
 |   (single-click ont he filename). These filenames will be   |||
 |   taken over in the F'Request dialog (ALT+Q) automatically. |||
 | - "Cntrl+Shift+RETURN" kills all msgs with the same subject.|||
 | - "NUM 5" selects the first msg in a msg thread.            |||
 | - Cntrl+^/v jumps to the top/bottom of screen.              |||
 | - The origin address of the current mail is used as default |||
 |   for the filerequest.                                      |||
 | - Texteffects in subject-line are printed now.              |||
 | - Bugfix: "Change area" dialog works correctly when         |||
 |   MsgListWindow is open.                                    |||
 | - "Indent" changed. LED does only indent lines when this    |||
 |   function is really switches on.                           |||
 | - New switch: "Switches->GEM infoline". Some people dislike |||
 |   LED's own infoline in the MsgWindow. Now you can tell LED |||
 |   to use the original GEM-Infoline in that window.          |||
 |   This switch will be active when LED is restarted.         |||
 |   Note: When using the original GEM infoline you might not  |||
 |   be able to click on the msg number in the infoline to     |||
 |   select a msg (if so click under the msg number) and the   |||
 |   actual msg number is displayd '*n*'.                      |||
 | - Bugfix: "Recognize ^CHRS" can be toggeled correctly with  |||
 |   ALT+7).                                                   |||
 | - LED can create random footlines. If you want to use this  |||
 |   option place a file called "LED.FLN" in LED's             |||
 |   systemfolder. For more information: See demofile.         |||
 |   To use that option for all areas switch on "Switches->    |||
 |   Random footline" or use the AREAS.BBS command             |||
 |   "-RandomFootline" to use it for specified areas.          |||
 |   It is possible to define for each area its own file with  |||
 |   "-FootlineFile <file>".                                   |||
 |     1. "-FootlineFile <file>" set in AREAS.BBS?             |||
 |        Yes: Take a random footline from <file>.             |||
 |     2. "-RandomFootline" or switch "Switches->Random..."    |||
 |        set?                                                 |||
 |        Yes: Take a random footline from LED.FLN.            |||
 | - New Option: "Switches->MsgWindow->...autoclose window".   |||
 |   The MsgListWindow will be closed automatically when a msg |||
 |   has been selected.                                        |||
 | - New option: "Quote->No topline in netmail" suppresses the |||
 |   topline in netmail area.                                  |||
 | - LED allows to define 20 function keys now. FKeys F11-F20  |||
 |   are called with SHIFT+F<n>. The old <SHIFT> functions     |||
 |   can be called with CONTROL+F<n> now:                      |||
 |     Control+F10: Clear all unread flags                     |||
 |     Control+F9 : All lastread pointers to maximum           |||
 |     Control+F8 : Lastread pointer to maximum                |||
 |     Control+F7 : Print msg with formfeed                    |||
 |     Control+F6 : Sort headers by date (current area)        |||
 |     Control+F5 : Change user name.                          |||
 |     Control+F2 : Small msginfo                              |||
 |     Control+F1 : Shortcut                                   |||
 |   The functionkey texts can be used in quotes with %01 to   |||
 |   %20 now.                                                  |||
 | - "^REPLYADDR:" will be treated correctly, too.             |||
 | - Columns increased by 5 (MsgWindow max 85 cols).           |||
 | - A maximum of 40 cc's is possible (30 before).             |||
 | - Bold quoted lines will be printed.                        |||
 | - Userlist-Dialog-Functions rewritten (hope it works).      |||
 | - Carbon-Copy-Dialog a little bit improved. Found names     |||
 |   will be displays immediatly.                              |||
 | - Bugfix: Shift+F8 with READ does not display the last msg. |||
 | - The Forward-Dialog shows the PrivateUserList now when the |||
 |   name field is empty and the dialog is exited with "OK".   |||
 | - When searching for a name with "Extras->Find in Userlist" |||
 |   and the top window is the EditWindow, the name and        |||
 |   address will be inserted at the cursor position (only     |||
 |   when leaving the dialogbox with "OK").                    |||
 | - New switch: "Options->Quote->No compression"              |||
 |   Normally LED quotes msg as follows:                       |||
 |   Original:                                                 |||
 |   | This is an example!                                     |||
 |   |            ^^^^^^^ note this word                       |||
 |   Quoted version:                                           |||
 |   | XY> This is an example!                                 |||
 |   | XY>        ^^^^^^^ note this word                       |||
 |   Advantage: Normally no line wrap because spaces are       |||
 |   overwritten by quote signs.                               |||
 |   Disadvantages: Tabulars and marks are destroyed normally. |||
 |   When using "No compression" LED creates following:        |||
 |   | XY> This is an example!                                 |||
 |   | XY>            ^^^^^^^ note this word                   |||
 | - Lines will be quoted correctly. Older versions quoted     |||
 |   "> >" as ">>"; now LED creates the correct quote ">> >".  |||
 | - Bugfix: When leaving the address-selectorbox with "OK"    |||
 |   using the mouse LED returned a wrong address (0:0/0).     |||
 | - New parameters %o and %O will be replaced by the complete |||
 |   from/to name.                                             |||
 | - It is possible to use HOME and Shift+HOME in the MsgList- |||
 |   Dialog.                                                   |||
 |                                                             |||
 | Attention! For experts only!                                |||
 | It is possible to call macros about the funtionkeys. That   |||
 | is not(!) trivial, so be carefull when using it!            |||
 |                                                             |||
 |   A macro that is only allowed in the EditWindow can be     |||
 |   defined as follows: %[keylist]                            |||
 |   and when it is only allowed in the MsgWindow: &[keylist]  |||
 |   macros for both windows can be defined with: $[keylist]   |||
 |                                                             |||
 |   "Keylist" is a list in the following format: SSAAK        |||
 |     SS=Scancode                                             |||
 |     AA=ASCII-Code                                           |||
 |     K =Status (1=RShift,2=LShift,4=Ctrl,8=Alt)              |||
 |   You must use that format exactly! The codes (in hex) are  |||
 |   seperated with commas. LED may crash when making a        |||
 |   mistake!                                                  |||
 |   I will remove that feature when it does not work properly |||
 |   on all TOS versions. "ALT+Key" actions can not be         |||
 |   initiated (seems to be a bug in TOS).                     |||
 |                                                             |||
 |   Here are two small examples (if you have definied another |||
 |   interesting macroa please tell me about it):              |||
 |   e.g. for F1:   %[21064,30024,2d184,21064]                 |||
 |    and for F2:   &[1e014,47000,1c0d0]                       |||
 |   F1 - Erase text from cursor to end of text                |||
 |        Keys: Ctrl+F, Ctrl+B, Ctrl+X, Ctrl+F                 |||
 |   F2 - Select first area (Netmail)                          |||
 |        Keys: Ctrl+A, HOME, RETURN                           |||
 |                                                             |||

 | Recognization of CHARSET/CHRS:                              |||
 |                                                             |||
 |   LED converts following charsets into the Atari-ST         |||
 |   character set, when the switch "Recognize ^CHRS" is       |||
 |   selected:                                                 |||
 |    Level-1:                                                 |||
 |      FRENCH,GERMAN,ITALIAN,NORWEG,PORTU,SPANISH,SWEDISH,UK  |||
 |    Level-2:                                                 |||
 |      LATIN-1,IBMPC,ASCII                                    |||
 |   The CHRS/CHARSET kludge has a higher priority then the    |||
 |   AREAS.BBS statement "-Latin1" or "-Latin1small".          |||
 |   The convertion only works properly when no IBMPC font is  |||
 |   installed (because LED tries to convert all chars into    |||
 |   the normal systemfont).                                   |||
 |   Tip: Normally you need only the general conversion with   |||
 |        "-Latin1small" to read a Latin-1 mail.               |||
 |                                                             |||

 |   LED now expects to find most of it's files in a folder    |||
 |   called "LED". This must be located in the same directory  |||
 |   that LED.PRG is in!                                       |||
 |                                                             |||
 |   Overview:                                                 |||
 |                                                             |||
 |   - Following files are searched in the folder "LED" only:  |||
 |       LED.CFG, LED.PRN, LED.SCT, LED.FKY, LED.DLG, LED.OPT  |||
 |                                                             |||
 |   - The following files will be recognized when situated in |||
 |     the same folder as LED.PRG, or in the folder that the   |||
 |     environment variable MAILER (or BINKLEY) points to, or  |||
 |     in the folder that "MailerPath" in LED.CFG points to:   |||
 |       BINKLEY.CFG, TB.CFG, NEWECHOS.LST, AREAS.BBS, ACS.CFG |||
 |                                                             |||
 |   - Follwing files are treated in an especially way:        |||
 |       LED.NEW : If this file is found in the LED folder, it |||
 |                 will be read from there only; else LED.NEW  |||
 |                 is expected to be in the same folder as the |||
 |                 AREAS.BBS file.                             |||
 |       LED.LOG : This (error) file will be created in the    |||
 |                 LED folder unless the statement "Logfile"   |||
 |                 in LED.CFG defines a different logfile.     |||
 |                                                             |||

 | - Tabsize=0 does not crash LED.                             |||
 | - Optionally the READ flag for each msg can be set with     |||
 |   Shift+F8 (set lastread pointer to maximum). Usefull when  |||
 |   using JetMail with 'NoDeleteUnread'.                      |||
 | - Searching for a mail with "Find" sets the READ flag on    |||
 |   all found msgs.                                           |||
 | - In "Switches" you can define which keys become 'deadkeys'.|||
 |   So you can enter nearly all characters now.               |||
 |   Switch "'„' in [net|echo]area" will be ignored when       |||
 |   entering '„”Ž™š' using a deadkey.                        |||
 | - ST-GUIDE will be supported. ST-GUIDE searches for the word|||
 |   under the cursor when pressing HELP in the EditWindow;    |||
 |   HELP in all other windows displays the hypertext LED.HYP. |||
 | - Numeric fields can be deleted by pressing ESC in MoveMsg  |||
 |   dialog.                                                   |||
 | - Searching for addresses in userlists corrected.           |||
 | - LED recognizes the ">AREA xxx"-(Pseudo)Kludge (written by |||
 |   JetMail and IMHO IOSmail in the PrivateMailBox-Area).     |||
 |   This kludge will not be quoted (or removed) when quoting  |||
 |   (or replying) a mail (except "Quote to area").            |||
 | - "Options->Switches->Use GDOS for printing" allows to      |||
 |   print a msg using GDOS. LED.PRN is not neccessary when    |||
 |   this switch is selected and "Add formfeed" will be        |||
 |   ignored. But when using GDOS it is also not longer        |||
 |   possible to make character conversions for the printer.   |||
 |   Now you can choose: Fast printing with printer font and   |||
 |   usage of LED.PRN, or nice (and slower) printing using     |||
 |   GDOS ;-)                                                  |||
 | - When selecting "Set cursor" (Options->Quote) LED sets the |||
 |   cursor (e.g. when quoting a mail) in the first textline   |||
 |   and not in the first msgline!                             |||
 | - When writing a reply in the netmail REPLYTO and REPLYADDR |||
 |   will be recognized.                                       |||
 | - The uucp-gate "To:" will be created in the netmail only.  |||
 | - Following shortcuts are shown in the status line:         |||
 |     HC - Header cache aktiv                                 |||
 |     RC - Recognize CHRS-Kludge                              |||
 |     TE - Text effects                                       |||
 | - Status of buttons in the frequest dialog will be saved    |||
 |   correctly.                                                |||
 | - MAJOR-BUGFIX in VDI init functions. Sometimes LED tried   |||
 |   to open a wrong workstation. That bug is was in all LED   |||
 |   versions so far!                                          |||
 | - When using "-Quote_nachricht" LED writes to "Alle" not    |||
 |   "All". People who are using a free defined quote cannot   |||
 |   use that feature.                                         |||
 | - When forwarding a msg the "address correction" is enabled |||
 |   automatically now (so LED can set your origin address     |||
 |   correctly). Also the forward of non-exported msgs will    |||
 |   work properly now.                                        |||
 | - Textsearching is up to 50% faster now because of the      |||
 |   implementing of a new search algorithm:                   |||
 |     When not switching on "Use allquantor (*)" the search   |||
 |     will be up to 50% faster! It is still allowed to use    |||
 |     the wildcard '?'.                                       |||
 | - BugFix: Texteffects will be shown when blockmarks are     |||
 |   shown reverse.                                            |||
 | - Shift+F9 asks if NewMsg flags should be reset, too.       |||
 | - When deleting a msg in the MsgListWindow the cursor jumps |||
 |   to the next line and not to the next msg!                 |||
 | - Shortcut function improved. Now you can insert complete   |||
 |   files. The syntax is:                                     |||
 |     - <name>, <filename>                                    |||
 |   Example: "- My footer, D:\FIDO\FOOTER.SIG"                |||
 |   When you select this entry the file FOOTER.SIG will be    |||
 |   inserted.                                                 |||
 |   An entry consists of max. 128 characters now.             |||
 |   The '|' character and all following characters and spaces |||
 |   before will not be inserted into the text (EditWindow).   |||
 | - "KeepCopy|Forward" status in MoveMsg dialog will be saved.|||
 | - "REPLYADDR name <addr>" is recognized.                    |||
 | - "Extend Tabs" corrected.                                  |||
 | - Quoting functions changed. Try following:                 |||
 |   a) Add some words in a quoted line and see what happens.  |||
 |   b) Write something like "HelloWorld> " at the beginning   |||
 |      of a line and then write some lines of text after it   |||
 |      (try it with "Indent" switched on and off and see what |||
 |      happens).                                              |||
 | - Opening of an EditWindow rewritten (hope it works).       |||
 | - It is not allowed to use relative paths in AREAS.BBS now. |||
 | - When forwarding a msg an existing CHRS kludge is not      |||
 |   removed when LED does not create a new one (LED creates   |||
 |   a new one, when "-Umlaute" or "-IOSconvert" is used).     |||
 | - "-Convert" renamed to "-Latin1small"                      |||
 |   LED tries to interprete all Latin-1 characters when using |||
 |   "-Latin1" instead of "-Latin1small". For german NewsGroups|||
 |   you should use "-Latin1small".                            |||
 | - Problems with the statusline fixed!                       |||
 | - Some functions should be faster (Find,Copy with forward). |||
 | - Statusline should not "flicker" now.                      |||
 | - MsgInfo also shows msg flags.                             |||
 | - Proportional fonts are supported a little(!) bit better   |||
 |   in the MsgWindow.                                         |||
 |                                                             |||

 | - Click in the Statusline should work with all TOS versions.|||
 | - Special characters are not longer used for "Quote>".      |||
 | - TextEffects possible in subject line.                     |||
 | - LED uses its own printer-driver (LED.PRN) now. Without    |||
 |   this driver no character conversion is done. More about   |||
 |   the driver you will find in the folder DRIVER.            |||
 | - LED can print text effects now. To print effects you must |||
 |   switch on the "text effects" and "...also on printer",    |||
 |   too. It is important to have installed the correct        |||
 |   printer driver.                                           |||
 | - A msg with XF_LOCK flag set will be marked with a "x".    |||
 | - Search in userlist is a little bit faster and uses less   |||
 |   memory.                                                   |||
 | - Usernames in userlists can be (max) 35 characters long.   |||
 | - Pressing a key in a user-selectbox or in the shortcut     |||
 |   dialog jumps to the concerning username/shortcut.         |||
 | - When you press RETURN (or the OK button) without typing   |||
 |   in a username in the To-Field in the "To-User"-Dialogbox, |||
 |   you can select a name from the PRVTUSER.LST. The file     |||
 |   PRVTUSER.LST must be defined in in the userlist dialog.   |||
 | - ACS: LED only reads "EchoList" from ACS.CFG now.          |||
 | - LED does not crash when deleting a mail using Control+    |||
 |   Return in the MsgListWindow.                              |||
 | - ReplyCrc calculation improved (trailing spaces will not   |||
 |   be included in the calculation).                          |||
 | - Cursor will be set correctly when editing mails (there    |||
 |   a small bug that appeard when using page up/down).        |||
 | - "ALT+2" (Edit origin) removed.                            |||
 | - "Clipboard" works correct now.                            |||
 | - Some Bugfixes (e.g. redraw of status line, AreaListWindow |||
 |   does not crash when scolling, full window without redraw  |||
 |   problems and other).                                      |||
 | - "Skip scanner" removed. LED will not longer delete an     |||
 |   ExtraExportArea- or Netmail-Copy wenn deleting the        |||
 |   original msg.                                             |||
 | - "MoveMsg" completly rewritten. Hope it works :-)          |||
 |   Note: "MoveMsg" copies all kludges and seen-by's,         |||
 |   "MoveMsg/Forward" removes ALL kludges and Seen-By's!      |||
 | - "ForwardMsg" completly rewritten. Hope it works :-)       |||
 | - With that version of LED you will get a small program     |||
 |   that allows to compress userlists (it will cut all        |||
 |   unnecessary spaces in a userlist).                        |||
 |                                                             |||

 | AREAS.BBS flags (new in 1.27):                              |||
 |                                                             |||
 | -FORCEPVT        When this command is defined LED will      |||
 |                  set the PRIVATE flag automatically in      |||
 |                  echomails (BBS systems).                   |||
 |                                                             |||
 | - Saving the dialog positions works now. I have disabled    |||
 |   this code, but don't know why?!? When someone has         |||
 |   problems with it, switch of "Save Dialog Positions" and   |||
 |   delete the *.DLG file!                                    |||
 | - Some bugfixes (IMHO no new bugs).                         |||
 | - New parameter %s will be replaced by the subject.         |||
 | - Text effects will work properly with TT- and Speedo fonts.|||
 | - Text effects improved (99% should be shown correctly now).|||
 | - Some window redraws are changed again.                    |||
 | - MsgListWindow should work correctly (bombs sometimes when |||
 |   an area was empty).                                       |||
 | - Some minor corrections.                                   |||
 | - QBBS reply link will be shown in infoline correctly       |||
 |   works now on all systems).                                |||
 | - When you press RETURN in the To-Field in the netmail area |||
 |   (without a name typed in), you can select a name from the |||
 |   PRVTUSER.LST. The file PRVTUSER.LST must be defined in    |||
 |   in the userlist dialog.                                   |||
 | - "Change msg" in an empty area does not longer crash.      |||
 | - "Shortcut" dialog works now.                              |||
 | - "Control+Del" in MsgList-Window jumps to the next         |||
 |   readable msg.                                             |||
 | - New button in "Options->Comment tree": "NumPad in comment |||
 |   tree mode" (was removed in 1.26 and was also switchable   |||
 |   with "Show..:"; now reimplemented because some guys ask   |||
 |   me to do so).                                             |||
 | - Shift+Cntrl+L opens ALWAYS the MsgList DIALOG!            |||
 | - Menu items will be disabled correctly(?).                 |||
 | - LED recognizes "Re^n:" and when you quote a mail 'n' will |||
 |   be increased automatically. When you want to use that     |||
 |   style turn the switch "...'Re^n:' style" on.              |||
 | - It was possible to switch on "„ in netmail" and it was    |||
 |   also possible to save the flag. But when calling the      |||
 |   "Switches" dialog again it was reset.                     |||
 |                                                             |||

 | In "LED->About LED" you can now enter a "registration key". |||
 | User's who have registered already do not need a key, these |||
 | are recognized by LED. New user's may enter their personal  |||

 | THERE ARE NO RESTRICTIONS WHEN USING LED WITHOUT A KEY!!!   |||
 | With a key the PID in your msgs will read "LED x.xx",       |||
 | without it it will be "LED x.xx/unreg". There is no other   |||
 | difference (except a small logo that will be displayed for  |||

 | - "Address correction (echomails)" removed, as this is now  |||
 |   switchable for each area using a new flag in AREAS.BBS    |||
 |   (see below). "Address correction" for netmail remains; in |||
 |   addition you can specify that the "Fixed address" flag is |||

 | -FIXEDADDRESS    LED is to set the correct address for this |||
 |                  area resp. show the address selector box.  |||
 |                  Furthermore, the "Fixed address" flag will |||
 |                  be set automatically. This statement       |||
 |                  applies to echomail only, not to netmail!  |||
 | -NONEWECHO       Only for ACS User: This area will not      |||

 | - When switching of "MsgListWindow" or "AreaListWindow" the |||
 |   corresponding window is closed.                           |||
 | - More than 2^16 user can be read from a user list.         |||
 | - XF_READ will be set when a msg is entered locally.        |||
 | - Pressing Shift+F1 calls a dialog (Help->Shortcut) that    |||
 |   displays the contents of the textfile "LED.SCT". When the |||
 |   top window is an edit window, the selected line will be   |||
 |   inserted into your text.                                  |||
 | - Also when no origin name is found in the header, the mail |||
 |   will be displayed.                                        |||
 | - Search in userlists a little bit faster.                  |||
 | - Window handling changed.                                  |||
 |    - "Smart redraw" in Edit-Window should work now.         |||
 |    - Saving of window positions rewritten.                  |||
 |    - Some redraws removed.                                  |||
 |    - Scrolling works now (when only one msg line is         |||
 |      displayed).                                            |||
 | - Saving of msg>64kb is saver now.                          |||
 | - New help texts.                                           |||
 | - "Sort header" works correctly now.                        |||
 | - "Kommentar zu"-line will only created when msg comes from |||
 |   a MausEcho and is quoted into another area.               |||
 | - The comment tree will be rebuild only once when using     |||
 |   CarbonCopies now (saves a lot of time).                   |||
 | - When starting other programs the memory was not           |||
 |   deallocated. Now it should work even with AREAS.BBS files |||
 |   with more than 2000 or 3000 areas.                        |||
 | - Now you can change the "From"-name by pressing Shift+F5.  |||
 |   For more details please read "LED config file" (below).   |||
 | - move msg/forward changed again. The origin address is     |||
 |   always corrected now. The origin name is replaced by the  |||
 |   own name.                                                 |||
 | - LED creates 4d-frequestfiles (ORT) now and optional       |||
 |   a 4d-flowfile (OFT). Network frequests (5d) are also      |||
 |   possible now.                                             |||
 | - When quoting a mail names consisting of more than two     |||
 |   names are not longer cut.                                 |||
 | - Quotes "xy>" are also set correctly.                      |||
 | - The destination is shown in the "Select origin" dialog.   |||
 | - PATH line will be suppressed correctly now. IOSmail has a |||
 |   small bug that let LED 1.25 show the last PATH line       |||
 |   though PATH lines were suppressed.                        |||
 | - "Switches->Text effects" tries to recognize text          |||
 |   attributes:                                               |||
 |     _Text_ => Displays "Text" underlined                    |||
 |     *Text* =>   "     "    bold                             |||
 |     /Text/ =>   "     "    cursive                          |||
 |   Supposition: In front of (behind) a "*", "/" or "_" must  |||
 |   be a space (except: Start/End of line).                   |||
 |   The text attributes will be used until end of line.       |||
 |   Text attributes can be combined.                          |||
 |   ALT+2 switches that function on/off.                      |||
 |   ATTENTION: It is very diffcult to recognize if it is a    |||
 |              control character or not. When someone has     |||
 |              written a better function he should tell me    |||
 |              about it.                                      |||
 | - ALT+W in edit window formats a complete paragraph until a |||
 |   <cr> (or empty line) is found.                            |||
 | - Shift+ALT W in edit window formats a complete paragraph   |||
 |   until an empty line is found.                             |||
 | - Some minor redraw bugs removed.                           |||
 | - "'„' in echomail" implemented for scandinavian LED user   |||
 |   (especially for Magnus).                                  |||
 | - Home/Shift+Home works in MsgList-Dialog.                  |||
 | - Search forward works again (but as slow as in 1.24). It   |||
 |   cannot be changed, sorry.                                 |||
 | - Adresses with node=0 and point!=0 are shown correctly     |||
 |   now.                                                      |||
 | - Sometimes LED has not closed all windows. Fixed.          |||
 | - Font choosable for Msglist- and Arealist-Window.          |||
 | - Faster sorting of headers.                                |||
 | - Msgidcrc/Replycrc are not deleted when move-msg is used.  |||
 | - Changes of ^A switches are shown immediatly.              |||
 | - Comment tree is built aprox. 400% faster (area with       |||
 |   1200 msgs: 1.25 needed 12.8 sec, 1.26 needs 3.2 sec;      |||
 |   time measure done on a TT).                               |||
 | - You can use following parameters in quotes and function   |||
 |   key defaults: %f, %F, %t, %T, %a, %d, %D, %z, %n and %%   |||
 |   (double % for a single %).                                |||
 | - It is also allowed to use a parameter '%#' in quotes      |||
 |   (0<=#<=9) where <#> is the number of the function key.    |||
 | - Parameter %n works now.                                   |||
 | - New quoting functions implemented.                        |||
 | - WM_BUTTOMED (MultiTOS) is supported now.                  |||
 | - New switch: "...autoclose" closes arealist-window         |||
 |   automatically when an area was selected.                  |||
 | - New switch: "Always use ^REPLYADDR" for Uucp-Gateways.    |||
 | - A lot of optimizations (e.g. no resources will be         |||
 |   overwritten when using long areanames).                   |||
 | - Shift+F2 shows a short msginfo.                           |||
 | - All MsgFlags will be shown (except XF_READ) (and when you |||
 |   use a lot of flags then three lines will be used).        |||
 | - New option "Edit header flags".                           |||
 | - There is no longer a box above the fileselector. First it |||
 |   was not above the fs when using a higher resolution,      |||
 |   second it is better to use the extended fileselector of   |||
 |   tos 1.04 (and higher).                                    |||
 | - Comment tree is shown in a better way in the status line! |||
 | - Now you can click on a msg number in the status line to   |||
 |   select a msg only possible when the comment tree is       |||
 |   shown!).                                                  |||
 | - LED does not crash when closing a msgwindow and a msg is  |||
 |   edited.                                                   |||
 | - Forwarding a msg updates the msglist window now.          |||
 | - Nicer msg forward in netmail.                             |||
 | - MsgMsg copies all ^A lines (when displayed). When no      |||
 |   ^A line is displayed only the MSGID and REPLY is copied.  |||
 |   MoveMsg with forward creates no MSGID and no REPLY!       |||
 | - "Edit msgheader" works correct when setting MausFlags.    |||
 |   XF_IMMEDIATE implemented. Nicer Dialog now.               |||
 |   When entering a hex number for the flags, the settings of |||
 |   the buttons will be ignored!                              |||
 | - When all windows are closed it is possible to open a      |||
 |   window using "Area change".                               |||
 | - Window close/cycle is disabled when necessary.            |||
 | - Window slider handling improved.                          |||
 | - Complete screen redraw when LED is exited.                |||
 | - "Hide ^MSGID" extended to "Hide ^MSGID/REPLY/REPLYTO".    |||
 | - "Netmail Address-Correction" improved.                    |||
 | - Optical corrections.                                      |||
 | - "Switches->Rescue lastreads" saves the lastread pointers  |||
 |   when exiting an area. The NewMsgFlag is not deleted any   |||
 |   more!                                                     |||
 | - "Switches->Del new msg flag" causes all NewMsg flags to   |||
 |   be deleted when exiting LED.                              |||
 | - In the "Quote" lines "cr" (Ctrl+M) is allowed. "Quotes"   |||
 |   may now take up more than two lines.                      |||
 | - Some unimportant "Switches" removed.                      |||
 | - "Change msg" and some other functions are faster now.     |||
 | - Six user lists.                                           |||
 | - Font names are being displayed with up to 24 characters   |||
 |   (used to be 16).                                          |||
 | - When coosing a font, clicking on the font name will cause |||
 |   the first font (system font) to be displayed. This is     |||
 |   useful if many fonts have been loaded. (Sorry, couldn't   |||
 |   implement a popup yet.)                                   |||
 | - Fixed a capital bug in the GEM routines. It only became   |||
 |   obvious when I compiled LED with a different GEM library  |||
 |   for testing purposes.                                     |||
 | - The lastreads are not reset to 1 any more when executing  |||
 |   another program from within LED.                          |||
 | - "Options->Quote" expanded and changed quoting method.     |||
 |   Now you can specify a different text for quoting to       |||
 |   another area. Example:                                    |||
 |   Native:                                                   |||
 |       "In einer Msg vom %d tippte %f %F (%a) an %t %T:"     |||
 |   to area:                                                  |||
 |       "In einer Msg vom %d tippte %f %F (%a) an %t %T       |||
 |        in Area '%n':"                                       |||
 |   English:                                                  |||

 | As some users would like the LED to reside in a different   |||
 | directory without having to specify an environment variable |||
 | I decided to design an optimal config file for the LED.     |||
 | The following statements are allowed in LED.CFG:            |||
 |                                                             |||
 |   SYSOP   name                    -> as in BINKLEY.CFG      |||
 |   ADDRESS address [fakenet]       -> ditto                  |||
 |   LOGFILE file                    -> ditto                  |||
 |   NETMAIL file                    -> ditto                  |||
 |   HOLD    path                    -> ditto                  |||
 |   SHELL   prg                     -> ditto                  |||
 |                                                             |||
 | Optionally the following statements may be added:           |||
 |                                                             |||
 |   MAILER   path                                             |||
 |   AKASYSOP name                                             |||
 |                                                             |||
 | - "MAILER" may be used to specify the directory of          |||
 |   AREAS.BBS and NEWECHOS.LST (ACS).                         |||
 | - Now you can use up to four different names (changeable    |||
 |   with Shift+F5). Just use "AKASYSOP" in the same way as    |||
 |   you use "SYSOP".                                          |||
 |   ATTENTION: WHEN USING BINKLEY.CFG TOGETHER WITH           |||
 |              BINKLEY.TTP you must use the statement         |||
 |              "APPLICATION AKASYSOP" instead of "AKASYSOP"!  |||
 |              The LED is always registered for the person    |||
 |              named in the SYSOP statement. When other user  |||
 |              are working with a registered LED version they |||
 |              had to pay the shareware fee, too!             |||
 |                                                             |||
 | On startup, LED tries to find one of the following files:   |||
 | 1. LED.CFG, 2. BINKLEY.CFG, 3. TB.CFG                       |||
 | These files are usually expected in LED's directory but     |||
 | TB.CFG and BINKLEY.CFG may also be placed in a different    |||
 | directory using the environment variables MAILER or BINKLEY |||
 | to point to that directory.                                 |||
 |                                                             |||
 | Note:                                                       |||
 |                                                             |||
 | I had to make changes to LED.OPT again, hopefully for the   |||
 | last time.                                                  |||

 | - In further LED versions I will use the lower byte of      |||
 |   mailer[6] to store the number of the "Address" line used  |||
 |   for the origin of the msg.                                |||
 |   Is it "0" LED could not found a proper "Address" line or  |||
 |   the user does not use the "Address correction".           |||
 |   The higher byte of mailer[6] is reserved and should be    |||
 |   zero.                                                     |||
 |   This feature is implemented in LED 1.26 but not yet       |||
 |   available (because JetMail crashes when using mailer[6]). |||
 |   Please send me your opinion about my idea.                |||
 |   Example:                                                  |||
 |     Address   2:2446/110.6@fidonet.org                      |||
 |     Address   51:601/7.6@atarinet.ftn                       |||
 |     Address   90:400/410@nest.ftn                           |||
 |     Address   90:400/404.6@nest.ftn                         |||
 |   Writing a mail using 90:400/410 sets "mailer[6] = 3".     |||
 |   So the tosser can get the correct domain without a new    |||
 |   header format.                                            |||
 |                                                             |||

 | - Msglist can be put into a window.                         |||
 |   When switching "Switches->...use Comment-Tree" on the     |||
 |   Msglist will be shown using the comment tree.             |||
 |   Does also work without header cache!                      |||
 | - MsgFlags will be shown in a long format (and when you use |||
 |   a lot of flags then two lines will be used).              |||
 | - New window functions.                                     |||
 | - Fontsize switchable for listwindows.                      |||
 | - New parameter %n. This parameter consists of the name of  |||
 |   the actually area.                                        |||
 | - You can use the same parameters allowed in quotes with    |||
 |   function keys (%f, %F, %t, %T, %a, %d, %D, %z and %n).    |||
 | - New quoting functions implemented.                        |||
 | - Automatically formfeed ("Print msg ^P") switchable.       |||
 | - Printing of Arealist/Msglist is possible.                 |||
 | - When using AVALON and LED in a multitasking OS you can    |||
 |   start AVALON via the LED requestbox.                      |||
 | - 63 small bugfixes ;-)                                     |||
 | - Netmailarea will be shown even if not defined in          |||
 |   AREAS.BBS.                                                |||
 | - Faster forward searching with ALT-F                       |||
 | - When moving msgs the comment tree will be reread now.     |||
 | - Bugfix: When undeleting msgs no incorrect flag is set.    |||
 | - Switching on "Switches->Show areadescription" shows the   |||
 |   areadescription in the Areawindow.                        |||
 | - MSGID and REPLY can consist of 200 characeters now.       |||
 | - Max. 32767 areas allowed in AREAS.BBS. Each area needs    |||
 |   approx. 400 Byte of memory (LED 1.23 and below needs      |||
 |   200 KByte for 512 areas).                                 |||
 | - Now you can choose if you want to hide the MSGID or other |||
 |   ^A-lines with "Switches->Hide ^A lines...".               |||
 | - LED uses the "^REPLYTO" statement when "Switches->Always  |||
 |   use ^REPLYTO" is turned on. Usefull for UUCP gateways.    |||
 | - When LED 1.24 crashes it was a problem with the stack.    |||
 |   I have compiled LED with 'only' 16 KByte of stack, but    |||
 |   it needs up to 19 KByte! Now 16 KByte should be more than |||
 |   enough for LED 1.25.                                      |||
 | - New font selection.                                       |||
 | - "Indent" is temporary switched of when a functionkey is   |||
 |   pressed.                                                  |||
 | - Header can be sorted by date with Shift+F7.               |||
 |                                                             |||
 | - LED can use the correct address for netmails and          |||
 |   echomail now ("Switches->Address correction ...").        |||
 |   This feature is useless with JETmail, IOSmail,            |||
 |   Ecu/Llegada because these tosser put their own address    |||
 |   into the msg header. I have implemented it, because it    |||
 |   might be usefull in future. It works not with             |||
 |   'Skip Scanner'!                                           |||
 | - Now you can tell JETmail 0.99beta11 (and higher) that the |||
 |   origin address should not be changed by the tosser.       |||
 |   The flag is named "Fixed address" and can be switched on  |||
 |   e.g. with ALT-V. When setting that flag the user is       |||
 |   responsible that the mail gets the correct origin         |||
 |   address.                                                  |||
 |   TIP: Switch on "Switches->Address correction (Netmail)",  |||
 |        so it is possible to select and fix the correct      |||
 |        address when it is necessary.                        |||
 |                                                             |||
