 1. General Information
 ======================

 LED if an editor for FidoNet messages which are stored in "THE-BOX"
 packet format.  LED replaces THE-BOX's message editor (almost) completely
 and gives you on top of that a few extra functions.

 If you've already worked with CanED for some time, then you'll find that
 you must change your habits slightly.  But in the long run the comfort
 and extra functions will more than make up for it.  Unlike CanED, LED is
 fully integrated into GEM, with a Menu line, Windows, and Dialog boxes,
 with all their advantages and weaknesses.  Along with mouse usage, just
 about all functions can be accessed from your keyboard.



 2. Files needed and Installation
 ================================

 Besides this manual you should have:

    LED.PRG  -  the program in question.
    LED.RSC  -  the ressource.

 The Resource File has been included in this version of the program. This has
 the advantage that a *.RSC file doesn't have to be loaded along with the
 program and it can't get lost or deleted.  If you have a LED.RSC file, it 
 belongs to an older version of LED, you can remove it without feeling guilty.

 If you have CanED installed then just copy LED.PRG into the same folder.

 LED also needs the following files (not part of LED.PRG):

    BINKLEY.CFG
    or
    TB.CFG       -    The Mailer configuration file, this contains your
                      paths, Node List etc...

    AREAS.BBS    -    List of Areas which you've requested. This also
                      belongs to THE-BOX's installation.

 If you've already worked with THE-BOX programs then you have to have these
 two files, if not, then please read THE-BOX's or Binkleys documentation 
 for more information on creating them.

 You should pay special attention to the file paths that are contained in 
 TB.CFG (BINKLEY.CFG) and AREAS.BBS which LED needs, in TB.CFG (BINKLEY.CFG)
 the NETMAIL path and in AREAS.BBS all your Area paths.  
 If the disk drive identification is missing as part of the path then LED 
 defaults to the disk drive to the current active drive.  When only a 
 relative path is givin (that is, a path without drive identification or 
 a backslash at the beginning) then the actual path from where the editor 
 resides is set in front of the existing path. 
 
 With THE-BOX programs, you can generally distinguish between two types of
 installations:

 a) With the Environment Variable 'MAILER' or 'BINKLEY'.
    Here the Shell Variable, MAILER or BINKLEY, should be set to the 
    same path as the configuration folder. In this folder you should 
    have all of your configuration files (TB.CFG or BINKLEY.CFG, AREAS.BBS, 
    etc...). The Mailer and LED must be started from their respective 
    shell program.

 b) Without 'MAILER' or 'BINKLEY'.
    If you don't use a shell, and an Environment Variable, then the
    configuration files have to be in the same folder as the other THE-BOX
    programs, along with LED.

 In the same folder, as the one containing TB.CFG and AREAS.BBS, LED looks
 for an existing LED.NEW file. LED saves the last read message number of 
 the individual areas in it. You can edit this file with an ASCII-Editor 
 by yourself if you want. 

 File Structure:
POINTS           58   1  <--- new Msgs
ATARI.GER        862  3  <--- new unread Msgs
ST_FIDO.GER      534  2  <--- unread Msgs
ATARI_ST         134  0  <--- no Flags
^                ^    ^--- Bit 0 = new Msgs, Bit 1 = unread Msgs
|                |
--- Areaname     --- last read Msg

The LED.NEW File is also used by Come_In and Tidy_Up (both from the 
ACS Packet).


 LED also creates the following three files, in the same folder as TB.CFG
 and AREAS.BBS:

    LED.OPT  - Contains LED-Options, number of windows (along with their 
               positions) and fonts selection, when LED is exited.  If the 
               file doesn't exist, it is created.

    LED.KEY  - Contains Function Key usage, this file is created when
               the function key usage is saved.

    LED.DLG  - Contains the Koordinates of the flying Dialogs.


 3. Starting the program
 =======================

 You can start the program now that you've copied LED.PRG in the same
 folder as CanED.  The program first reads your configuration files (TB.CFG
 and AREAS.BBS) which belong to THE-BOX and then opens a window showing the
 last read message.

 You can have a maximum of four 'Message Windows' opened at the same time
 in which to display messages. You can position, change between, open and
 close these windows as often as you want.

 When you want to enter a message, the active message window becomes an 
 'Edit Window'.  This is always a full screen window, or at least the width 
 can't be changed, athough its heigth can be.  Message and edit windows can
 have a maximum width of 79 characters.  On a normal monochorom monitor the 
 scoll bar on the right hand side of the screen can overlap some characters
 when maximum number of columns is used.  76 character screens are a good
 compormise for message and edit window sizes.
 
 Not only can other message widows be opened, you can also switch back and 
 forth between them.  When you finish editing, the edit window returns to 
 a message window again.

 Only one window can be opened at one time per area.  If you want to a second
 window in an area that already has an opened window that window will then
 become active, if not already active.

 If a message window is open, you can use the following keyboard short cuts:

 <CUR-DOWN>           = one line down
 <CUR-UP>             = one line up
 <SHIFT>-<CUR-DOWN> or
 <SPACE>              = one page down
 <SHIFT>-<CUR-UP> or
 <SHIFT>-<SPACE>      = one page up

 <CLR-HOME>           = to text begin
 <SHIFT>-<CUR-HOME>   = to text end
 <SHIFT>-<CUR-RIGHT>  = shift text to the right (within window)
 <SHIFT>-<CUR-LEFT>   = shift text to the left  (within window)

 <CUR-RIGHT> or
 <N>                  = display next message
 <CUR-LEFT> or
 <P>                  = display previous message

 <RETURN>             = display next message in the reading direction

 <)> (number block)   = display the next message with the same subject
                        (beginning 'Re:' will be ignored)
 <CTLR-)> (number     = display the next message with the same subject with
            block)      regard to the sender (-> old sender is new receiver)

 <(> (number block)   = display the previous message with the same subject
                        (beginning 'Re:' will be ignored)

 <CTRL-(> (number     = display the previous message with the same subject
            block)      with to the receiver (-> old receiver is new sender)

 Additional number block keys:

 <0> thru <9>         = goto message
 <+>                  = change to next area
 <->                  = change to previous area
 <*>                  = change to next area with new messages
 </>                  = change to next area with unread messages


 You doen't have to remember all these key combinations, they can be found
 under the menu item 'Help', or just by pressing the HELP key. 



 4. Menu functions
 =================

 Along with each menu item, a keyboard short cut character is shown:
 '^'   stands for the <CONTROL> key,
 ''   stands for the <ALTERNATE> key and
 '...' means that a Dialog box will be displayed.




 I. 'LED'
 ========

 A) 'About LED...'
 -----------------

 Information dialog with author information, Copyright mark, Version
 number, Compilation date, and Free memory indication.  The addresses of
 the two authors can also be found here.  We would be please if you would
 send us a picture postcard of your home town in appreciation.  Otherwise
 when you have questions or problems with LED or your 'Point' you can 
 contact us, the best way is per Netmail.


 B) 'Accessories'
 ----------------

 Self explanatory.




 II. 'File'
 ==========

 This Menu contains the File-Input/Output functions.
 

 A) 'Read ASCII...'
 ------------------

 A text file will be added to the message being edited at the currect cursor
 position.

 The text file is selected with the help of a file selector box.


 B) 'Write ASCII...'
 -------------------

 One or more messages will be written to a file in ASCII format.

 A dialog box is displayed, just like the 'Kill Msg' dialog box, where you
 can enter the Beginning and Ending message numbers.  Then you get a file
 selector box where you can enter the output file name.


 C) 'Append ASCII...'
 --------------------

 The actual message will be added to a file.

 In case you haven't previously selected a file name, a file selector box
 will be displayed so that you can enter the file name.


 D) 'Read Clipboard'
 --------------------

 When editing a message, you can insert text, beginning at the currect cursor 
 position, from the Clipboard file SCRAP.TXT. 


 E) 'Write Clipboard'
 --------------------

 The current message is written to the Clipboard file SCARP.TXT.

 With the help to these two functions, its possible to easily exchange ASCII 
 files with other programs, it requires, of course, that they also use the 
 Clipboard. 


 E) 'Execute...'
 ---------------

 Here you can execute a TOS or GEM program from within LED.  A file selector
 box is displayed so that you can select the program you wish to run.  When 
 the program is ended LED is automatically started again.  Because LED reads
 the configurations files TB.CFG and AREAS.BBS after every program start its
 possible to call a text editor from within LED, make changes to these files,
 and save them; LED then takes these changes into consideration.


 F) 'Quit'
 ---------

 LED closes its windows, writes the 'Last read' Pointers to LASTREAD.CED,
 and (if the option is active) the area size and unread pointers to LED.NEW.
 Position and number the open windows, the selected fonts and all other 
 options are stored in the LED.OPT file, so that the next time LED is started
 you are returned to the same environment from which you left.  If you don't
 wish this, you can bypass the saving of LED.OPT by pressing the <SHIFT> key 
 while leaving LED.  If generally, you don't want to save LED.OPT when 
 quiting, you should set off the option 'Save always LED.OPT', found in the 
 'LED-Options'.





III. 'Area'
===========

 This Menu contains functions for the Message Area. Within LED that means 
 the same thing as Window.


 A) 'Open...'
 ------------

 Another Message Window is opened.  In addition a new Area has to be 
 selected.  To do this, a dialog box is displayed, equivalent to  'Change' 
 (see the next Menu point) and is used in the same way.  The difference 
 between the two is here a new window is opened, while by 'Change' the 
 contents of the actual window are altered.

 Only one window per Area can be opened.  If a window for the Area to be 
 selected is already open it will become active.  Only four windows can be
 opened at the same time.        


 B) 'Change...'
 -------------

 The Current Area is changed.

 A dialog box is displayed in which all of your Areas are listed.  You can 
 use the cursor keys (left, right, up and down) to pick out the area you 
 wish to change to.  Once you've selected the area you want, with the 
 inverted cursor bar, just press <RETURN> to activate that area.  You can, 
 of course, use the mouse for Area selection, one click on the left mouse 
 butten is enough.

 If you don't want to pick a new Area you can exit the dialog box by pressing 
 the Cancel Button with the mouse, pressing <ENTER> or the <UNDO> key.

 Next to the Area Names are two information characters (when the LED option
 'Show new/unread Msg' is active):

 '*' = The number of messages in this area has changed since the last
       LED session.  Normally this means that new messages have been
       written into this area during the last Poll.  This character is
       removed when you enter and leave this area.

 '/' = In this area the last message has not yet been read.  Normally this
       a sign that you have unread messages.  This character is shown
       independently of the number of times you enter and leave this area.

 (These characters are displayed without any guarantee, especially when
 new areas, AREAS.BBS, are added or deleted.  For these situations use
 SHIFT-F10 and/or SHIFT-F9 to set up the new conditions)

 If you want to by-pass the 'Area change...' menu item, you can use the
 following commands to change areas directly (keyboard number block only):

 '+' = Change to the next area on the area list.
 '-' = Change to the previous area on the area list.
 '*' = Change to the next area with 'new' messages.
 '/' = Change to the next area with 'unread' messages.
   

 C) 'Cycle...'
 -------------

 When more then one message window is opened, use this function to flip
 through the windows one after the other.


 D) 'Close...'
 -------------

 An open message window will be closed.  This is the same as clicking on
 the window's 'GEM Window Closer' (in the upper left hand corner).





 IV. 'Message'
 =============

 All items within this menu relate to the active message window, the window
 which is on top if more than one window is open.  If no windows are open
 then none of the menu items can be chosen.
 LED supports maximal 4000 Msgs per Area. Each Msg with a maximum of 1000 
 lines (or 64KBytes).
 

 A) 'List...'
 ------------

 A list of items will be displayed, '#:' (message number), 'From:', 'To:', 
 and 'Subject:'.  You can roll foreward and backwards to pick out message 
 you want to read.

 A dialog box is displayed with a list of up to 18 messages.  At the
 top of the display, inverted, is the name of the actual, last read,
 message.  With the <SHIFT>-<CUR-DOWN> and <SHIFT>-<CUR-UP> you can access
 the previous, and next, 18 messages.  With <CUR-DOWN> and <CUR-UP> you can
 move the inverted cursor over the 18 displayed message subjects.  When you
 press <RETURN> to leave the dialog, the message indicated by the cursor
 will be displayed.  You can also pick out a message, using the mouse, just
 click once on the message you want.

 If you don't want to select another message you can exit the Dialog Box by 
 pressing the Cancel Button with the mouse, pressing <ENTER> or the <UNDO> 
 key.

 With the <CLR-HOME> key you can dispaly the first page of the Message Area 
 and with <SHIFT>-<CLR-HOME> the last page.

 Messages which have been deleted are shown in faded characters and can not
 be selected with the mouse.  You can selected them using the cursor keys 
 though.  Once a deleted message is selected, just press <RETURN> to 
 un-delete it and then display it.
 
 The roll bar on the right hand side of the dialog box is, of course, there
 for those who like to use the mouse and it functions similarly to the roll
 bar found in other programs, like the File Selector.  A click in the 'gray'
 area scrolls one page up or down.  When you move the slider, with the mouse,
 then the messages are positioned appropriately in relation to the slider.

 You can only control the display using the roll bar, a message is selected,
 for displaying, by using the <CUR-UP>, <CUR-DOWN>, or with the mouse.  

 On the left side of the dialog box are inverted arrows that indicate that a
 message is directed to the system sysop.  Messages which the sysop has 
 entered are indicated with a normal arrow.  The direction of the arrows show 
 if the message went out or came in.


 B) 'Goto...'
 ------------

 Display a message, selected via a number.

 You only have to enter the new message number in the dialog box and press
 'OK'.  If you enter a number which is lower than the first message in the
 area or higher than the last message then the first message or the last
 message, respectively, in that area will be retrieved and displayed.  If 
 you don't enter any number, or delete a number after entering one, the last 
 message displayed will be redisplayed.

 You can also call this dialog box from a message window by just pressing a
 number on the keyboard number block.


 C) 'Kill...'
 ----------------

 One or more messages can be marked as deleted, at the same time other flags
 can be set.

 In the displayed dialog box, you can enter the beginning and ending number
 of the message(s) to be processed.  Along with the Delete Flag, "Deleted", 
 other flags can be set (these are only useful in the Netmail Area):
 
 "Sent"   = a message with this flag will not be exported 
 "K/Sent" = this message will be marked as "Deleted" after the next export 
            run
 "Crash"  = the recipient of this message will be called directly by the 
            Point

 Marked messages are physically removed with such programs as COMSCAN, 
 FASTPACK, FCRUN, or TIDY_UP. 

 -> 'Quick Kill': with <CTRL>-<RETURN> you can delete (mark as deleted) the
                  actual message being displayed without being asked any 
                  further questions.


 D) 'Heal...'
 ------------

 Healing (removing) Flags. 

 As with 'Kill' a dialog box is displayed in which you can enter the beginning 
 and ending number of the messages to be healed as will as the other flags. 


 E) 'Forward...'
 ---------------

 A message will be sent to a new address.

 A dialog box will be displayed in which you can enter the name of the new
 recipient, address, for the message that is currently being shown.  If the
 address exist in your user list file then just click on the  'Userlist' 
 button, otherwise enter his node address along with his name.  
 
 When you leave the dialog box with 'OK' a copy of the message will be sent 
 to the new address the next time you export.


 F) 'Move...'
 ------------

 With this function you can move, or copy, one or more messages into another
 area.

 A dialog box is displayed in which you first have to enter a number of a
 message you want to move (moving of a message is done from the actual area
 into another area).  As default, the number of the actual message is
 already entered.  Just by changing the 'From' and 'To' field contents you
 can move any number of messages at the same time.

 Below and to the left of the dialog box, you have three options:

 'Remove Arealine' = If a destination exist 'AREA: xxxxxxxx', it will 
                     not be moved/copied with the message.

 'Keep Copy'       = Normally every message is moved into another area
                     and the original message is deleted, if you chose
                     this option the message is not removed.

 'Forward'         = The message gets a new address.  After you pick out
                     your destination, a dialog box is displayed where
                     you can enter the new address (Netmail Area
                     messages also get a FidoNet Address).

 After clicking 'OK' the previously faded list of Areas is highlighted.
 Just click with the mouse on the area to which the message is to be sent.
 Also refer to 'Change' in the above 'Area' section.


 G) 'Print'
 ----------

 The currently displayed message is printed.

 In case you want a page skip, after printing, then press <SHIFT-F8> while
 the message is displayed (instead of using the menu or <CTRL-P>). 


 

 V. 'Edit'
 =========

 A) 'Enter Msg'
 --------------

 Write a message in the current area.

 The Message Window becomes an Edit Window.  You must first enter the
 address and subject in the message header before you can enter your
 message.  Exit both lines with <RETURN> when your finished.

 If your in the FidoNetmail Area you will be asked for the Node Number via
 a dialog box.  Within this box is a button 'Userlist', you have two
 possibilities in which to enter the Node Number:

 1)  You must enter the complete (and correctly spelled) first and last 
     name of your recipient (address).  Then click on the 'Userlist' to  
     search the list (your Userlist file name is entered in the LED-Options'
     'USERLISTs').

 2)  You just enter the first initials of the first and last name of the
     wanted address.  Then when you click on 'Userlist' the first entry
     matching what you entered will be copied to the address field.  Just 
     click on 'OK' and it will be written into the message header.

 NOTE: If your in another area you can still use the 'Userlist' as described
 above to get the correct address but the Node Number is not displayed or
 used.

 The 'To:' and 'Subj.:' lines along with the message flags (top, right) can
 be edited at any time, you just have to point and click with the mouse.
 In the Netmail Area the 'Private Flag' is automatically set.

 Within the Edit Window you can use the following key combinations along
 with the normal cursor keys, <BACKSPACE> and <DELETE> keys:

 <SHIFT>-<CUR-UP>   = Cursor one page up.
 <SHIFT>-<CUR-DOWN> = Cursor one page down.

 <CLR-HOME>         = Cursor is positioned to the beginning of your text.
 <SHIFT>-<CLR-HOME> = Cursor is positioned to the end of the text.

 <INSERT>           = Switch between Overwrite/Insert.
 <CTRL>-<Y>         = Delete one line, the current line.

 The maximal width of the Edit Window is 75 characters (changeable via LED-
 OPTION).  You can enter your text without having to worry about carriage
 returns, word-break is automatic at the end of each line.

 You can cancel editing at any time by using 'Abort Msg'.  With 'Save Msg'
 the message is saved.  The saved message is then Exported the next time
 you poll.  In both cases you are returned to the message window from which
 you started.


 B) 'Reply Msg'
 --------------

 Entering of a message with 'Re:' to the current subject.

 Address and subject of the current message are automatically taken over
 into your message header and the cursor is positioned in the text area.
 In 'LED-Options' you can specify if 'Re:' should be added to the subject in the
 subject line.  But when five 'Re:'s are already there you should probably
 stop adding them.  You can, of course, change the 'To:' and 'Subj:' lines
 at any time, just point and click with the mouse.

 Otherwise the same commands and functions as 'Enter Msg' apply.


 C) 'Quote Msg'
 --------------

 Address and subject are automatically taken over into the new header lines
 and the message text is written to the edit window and set in quotes.   If 
 it has already been quoted, it is set in quotes again.  

 Via 'LED-Options' you specify your quote type, '>' or 'XY>', and also if an
 extra heading line is to be written at the top of you message, something 
 like: 
 
 "In a Message of <25 May 1990 ...".  

 If present this line can be in either English or German.

 All quoted lines are reformated to the edit window with a maximum of 75
 characters per line.  The program tries to fill out a line as completely
 as possible.  Use <CTRL>-<Y> to delete quoted lines you don't need and
 leave in lines which really have meaning to what you want to say.

 Otherwise the same commands and functions as 'Enter Msg' apply.


 D) 'Quote to Netmail'
 ---------------------

 This is the same as 'Quote Msg', except that the message will be written
 to the Netmail Area when saved.  Also the recipience's FidoNet address is
 automatically written to the message header (as long as the Origin is
 correct) and the 'Private' flag is set.

 Otherwise the same commands and functions as 'Enter Msg' apply.


 E) 'Change Msg'
 ---------------

 A new message will be created with the contents of the currentaly displayed
 message and you will be put into the message editor.  When you save the 
 message, the original message is automatically deleted (you can, of course,
 un-delete it later).

 If you use the 'Skip COMSCAM' option then a possible existing copy of the
 original message in the Netmail Area will be deleted.  The message is
 identified by its creation time.

 Otherwise the same commands and functions as 'Enter Msg' apply.


 F) 'Carbon Copy'
 ----------------

 With this function you can send the same message, via Netmail, to others 
 at the same time.

 At any time during your Netmail edit session you can call 'Carbon Copy'
 and, via dialog, enter the complete first and last names of your FidoNet
 addresses to which a message is to be sent.  You can also use the USERLIST, 
 refer to 'Edit Msg' above.


 G) 'Abort Msg'
 --------------

 Your message editing session is canceled and nothing is saved.  You will be
 returned to the last active message from which you came.


 H) 'Save Msg'
 -------------

 Your message will be saved to the end of your area file.  You will be
 returned to the message from which you came.




 VI. 'Block'
 ===========

 A) 'Begin/End'
 --------------

 The current line marked as Block Begin or Block End.  The line number is  
 also displayed in the Status Line.  The selected block is displayed as
 faded text.


 B) 'Del marks'
 --------------
 
 Any existing block marks will be removed.  The faded text returns to normal 
 intensity.


 C) 'Cut'
 --------
 
 The indicated block, of the actual message, is removed and copied into an
 internal buffer.  


 D) 'Copy'
 ---------

 The indicated block, of the actual message, is copied into the internal
 buffer without changing the message.


 E) 'Paste'
 ----------

 The contents of the Block Buffer is copied into your message starting at
 the current cursor position.  If a block is marked but hasn't been cut out 
 or copied a 'Paste' will be processed and then a 'Copy'.

 F) 'Indent'
 -----------

 Auto-Indent is turned on/off for the actual line.


 G) 'Ext TAB'
 ---------------

 If Tabulation characters exist, they will be replaced by the number of
 spaces indicated in LED-Options.  This is important for 'C' sources, and 
 similar text, when they are copied into a message.





 VII. 'Extras'
 =============

 A) 'LED-Options...'
 -------------------
 
 Here you select the options you want to work with.  Your options are
 stored in the LED.OPT file and are loaded into the program when its
 started.  If the option file doesn't exist, then default values will be
 used.

 'Maximum Window Columns:' = The maximum width of the message window in
                             characters per line.  The highest value is 80.
                             But as only 76 characters can be displayed on
                             a SM124 screen at once you have to scroll the
                             screen to see the rest.  Its recommended to
                             just use 76.  Messages are automatically
                             formatted to the screen.  If a message becomes
                             unreadable its recommended that you change the
                             option to 80 and then redisplay the message
                             (display previous message, display next
                             message).

 'Maximum Edit Columns:'   = The maximum width of the edit window in
                             characters per line.  The highest value is 75.


 'Edit-Window Tabsize:'    = LED aways shows TABs as spaces.  With this 
                             option the TAB size, the number of spaces, can
                             be set.  Every tabulator is extended by the 
                             number in the edit box.


 In the middle of the dialog box you'll find the basic LED parameters.  They 
 are listed from top to bottle starting on the left side. 
                             
 'Save always LED.OPT'    = When this is active all parameters in LED-Option 
                            along with the positions and sizes of the of the 
                            open windows are saved in the LED.OPT file when 
                            you 'Quit' LED.
                                                                                        
 'Save Dialog Position'   = When this is active the dialog positions will 
                            be written as LED.DLG every time you 'Quit' LED.

 'Header-Cache'            = When active then LED loads the entire header
                             file of an area into memory.  This increases
                             the speed of all program operations.  '(HC)'
                             is displayed in the information line of the
                             message window when the 'Header-Cache' is
                             active and the area in question is 'cached'
                             (buffered).

 'Skip Scanner'            = When this option is active then every message
                             which you enter in a Echomail Area is also 
                             copied to the Netmail Area with its AREA line 
                             and Origin, ready and waiting for EXPORT.  A 
                             separate Comscan run is no longer needed.

 'Add every "Re:"'         = 'Re:' is added the subject in every REPLY or
                             QUOTE you make when this option is active.
                             Otherwise its added only when no 'Re:' exist
                             in a subject line.

 'Hide "EID:..."'          = If active any existing EID Gludges in the
                             first line of a message will be removed.
                             When quoting a message, then generally, all
                             ^A lines are also removed.

 'Hide next  A Line'       = All following ^A lines are removed when this
                             option is active.

 'Show CR'                 = The CR (carriage return) character is shown
                             when editing.

 '"„" in Netmail-Area'     = When active the „ --> ae conversion in Netmail 
                             is not performed, the normal German umlaut can
                             be used in Netmail messages (useful only in 
                             German speaking countries).  Normally the German
                             umlaut is not allowed in Echomail Areas so when
                             one is entered, the '„' key is pressed, the
                             character is automatically replace with 'ae'.

 'Always extend Tabs'      = If a Msg contains TAB-characters they will be
                             extended as spaces to the desired size.

 'Delete new Msg Flag'     = If active the newmsg flags will be cleared every
                             time you quit LED. This way there won't be
                             any newmsg flags '*' set when you start LED 
                             again. If you import some new msgs you can see 
                             which areas got some msgs. 

  
 On the very right side you can select if quoted lines should start with
 the sender's initials 'XY>' or just '>'.


 On the bottom left, you can select the text that should be written at the
 beginning of a quoted message:


 'In a message...'         = If this is active then this well know header
                             will be created in English when quoting.

 'In einer Nachricht...'   = Wenn aktiv wird beim einen Quote eine
                             Kopfzeile in Deutsch erzeugt.
                             (Same as the text above, except a German
                             header is created when quoting.

 '*GER/AUS/CH detection'   = This option, when active, causes 'In einer
                             Nachrich...' to be written to the headers of
                             quoted messages when they belong to areas
                             with *.GER, *.AUS, or *.CH endings.
                             Otherwise 'In a message...' will be created.

 'None'                    = If this is active then heading line text won't 
                             be created.
 

 On the bottom right:
 
 'USERLIST':
 Up to four file names can be entered here, these files contain FidoNet
 participants with the same layout as FIDOUSER.LST.  The files will be
 search one after the other, from 1 to 4, in that order.  The user list
 can be in any folder on your harddisk or diskette.
 
 After a double clicking one of the editable fields a file selector box will
 be displayed so that a Userlist can be selected.  Only the selected Userlist 
 file name is shown in the LED-Option dialog box, but LED holds internally 
 the complete file path and saves it in the LED.OPT file.  Only one file path
 is used for all four Userlist.
 
 The first list, for example, could be your FIDOUSER.LST file, the next,
 your country's point list POINTUSE.LST and the third your own PRVTUSER.LST.
 The last file can be created and maintained with the help of LED, refer to
 'Add PRVTUSER.LST' below.

 With 'Save' you can save your actual configuration to the LED.OPT file.


 B) 'Font-Options...'
 --------------------

 For Message and Edit windows, text font types and sizes can be selected.

 If you don't used GDOS, only the font sizes can be selected.  Font sizes
 are shown in 'Points', so just click on the point size you want. 

 When GDOS (or AMC-GDOS) and some fonts have been loaded, 'GDOS active' (in 
 small characters) will be shown along with the dialog box title.  You can
 scroll through the fonts list using the arrows keys and the available font
 sizes are then shown below.  You can select for the two cusomary LED window 
 types, Message and Edit, separate fonts.  Although all fonts will be shown
 for selection, only fonts with a fixed character width can be used by the
 Edit window.  

 With the 'Font Effects' you can select whether you like the marked block 
 'highlighted' or 'revers' and perhaps the quoted lines to appear thickened.

 With 'Save' you store the currect font selection, in the file LED.OPT.
 These values will not be overwritten when LED.OPT is saved at program end. 


 C) 'Function Keys...'
 ---------------------

 The ten function keys can be programmed with your own little flourishes.
 If these little nothings need more than one line then you have to end it
 with <CTRL>-<M>, carriage return.  You can save your programmed function 
 keys with 'Save' to the LED.KEY file.

 The contents of the function keys can only be used in your message text area,
 not in the message header.


 D) 'Msg Header...'
 ------------------

 The 'Message Header' dialog box is displayed.

 One more internal command.  This shows all information pertaining to the
 message header structure of the message being currently shown.

 You can edit the 'mailer' field, the Origin, and Destination Nodes.  On
 top of that, you can turn the flags on and off as much as you like, these
 changes will also be saved.

 If you find a message in the Netmail Area with 'mailer[0]' thru 'mailer[2]',
 your Bosses Node number is present, or the SENT flag is set, this is a sign
 that the message has been exported with EXPORT.  If you set 'mailer[0]' 
 thru 'mailer[2] manually to [0] and remove the SENT flag, the message will be 
 exported again the next time EXPORT is started.  When you don't want a 
 message to be sent then you just have to set 'mailer[0]' thru 'mailer[2]' 
 to your Boss Node number.  

 If you leave the dialog with 'OK/Write' then the new header will 
 be saved, or with 'Cancel', then nothing is changed.  To be on the safe 
 side, 'Cancel' is the default button.


 E) 'File Request...'
 --------------------

 A corresponding BINKLEY File Request file will be created with you request.

 First the Node number of the requested system has to be entered via the
 displayed dialog box.  Then you can enter up to 12 file names which you
 want to request, along with their passwords if needed.  Lower case 
 characters will automatically be change to upper case characters when you 
 save the request file.

 Click on 'Make File' to save the your '*.REQ' file in the OUTBOUND
 folder.


 F) 'Add PRVTUSER.LST'
 ---------------------

 Write the name and address of a FidoNet user in the PRVTUSER.LST file.

 When you pick this entry a small dialog box will be displayed so you can
 confirm the sender's name, taken from the actual message.  If everything
 is OK the name and address will be written to the PRVTUSER.LST file,
 sorted alphabetically.  This file's layout is the same as FIDOUSER.LST.


 G) 'Find PRVTUSER.LST'
 ----------------------

 Look up names from the PRVTUSER.LST file.


 H) 'Msg to Sysop...'
 ----------------

 Messages to the Sysop are searched for using the last Logfile entries 
 written by IMPORT.

 After the search of the Logfile the Areachange dialog box will show only
 those Areas which have messages addressed to the Sysop.
  

 I) 'Find String...'
 -------------------
 
 Search in the actual Message Header file for a string or a string
 combination.

 You can search for stings in the three message header lines: 'From:',
 'To:', and 'Subj:'.  You can combined more then one string, for example,
 search all messages where somebody named 'Volkmar' (in 'From:') wrote to
 somebody else named 'Bohn' (in 'To:').
 You can also search for something written within the Text of the Msg. But
 this search is a bit slower.

 Normally the messages are searched forward of the actual message, but if
 'Backwards' is active then the other direction is searched.  Its
 recommended to do you searching when the LED-Option 'Header-Cache' is
 active, that is, only in windows where '(HC)' is shown.  Otherwise
 searching from a disk is pretty boring.


 J) 'Find Same'
 --------------
 Repeat the last search.




 VIII. 'Help'
 ===========

 This contains three help dialog boxes with keyboard shortcuts that haven't
 already been shown in the different menu lines:

 A) 'Msg-Window'
 B) 'Edit-Window'
 C) 'Dialogs'
