/* ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION AND/OR USE PROHIBITED		*/
/* WITHOUT WRITTEN PERMISSION FROM BIT BUCKET SOFTWARE CO.					*/
/*																			*/
/* Non-Commercial distribution and/or use is permitted under the following	*/
/* terms:																	*/
/*																			*/
/*																			*/
/* 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of BinkleyTerm source,	*/
/* documentation, and executable code as you receive it, in any medium, 	*/
/* provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy a */
/* valid copyright notice "(C) Copyright 1987-90, Bit Bucket Software Co."; */
/* keep intact the notices on all files that refer to this License			*/
/* Agreement and to the absence of any warranty;  PROVIDE UNMODIFIED COPIES */
/* OF THE DOCUMENTATION AS PROVIDED WITH THE PROGRAM; and give any other	*/
/* recipients of the BinkleyTerm program a copy of this License Agreement	*/
/* along with the program.	You may charge a distribution fee for the		*/
/* physical act of transferring a copy, but no more than is necessary to	*/
/* recover your actual costs incurred in the transfer. Under no 			*/
/* circumstances is BinkleyTerm to be distributed in such a way as to be	*/
/* construed as "value added" in a sales transaction, such as, but not		*/
/* limited to, software bundled with a modem or CD-ROM software 			*/
/* collections. 															*/
/*																			*/
/* 2. You may modify your copy or copies of BinkleyTerm or any portion of	*/
/* it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of		*/
/* Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:				*/
/*																			*/
/*	   a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating		*/
/*	   that you changed the files and the date of any change;				*/
/*																			*/
/*	   b) cause the executable code of such modified version to clearly 	*/
/*	   identify itself as such in the course of its normal operation;		*/
/*																			*/
/*	   c) if the modified version is not a "port", but operates in the		*/
/*	   same hardware and/or software environment as the original			*/
/*	   distribution, make the original version equally available,			*/
/*	   clearly identifying same as the original, unmodified version;		*/
/*																			*/
/*	   d) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish,		*/
/*	   that in whole or in part contains or is a derivative of				*/
/*	   BinkleyTerm or any part thereof, to be licensed at no charge to		*/
/*	   all third parties on terms identical to those contained in this		*/
/*	   License Agreement (except that you may choose to grant more			*/
/*	   extensive warranty protection to some or all third parties, at		*/
/*	   your option); and													*/
/*																			*/
/*	   e) send the complete source code modifications to Bit Bucket 		*/
/*	   Software Co. at one of the addresses listed below,  for the			*/
/*	   purpose of evaluation for inclusion in future releases of			*/
/*	   BinkleyTerm.  Should your source code be included in BinkleyTerm,	*/
/*	   Bit Bucket Software Co. retains all rights for redistribution of 	*/
/*	   the code as part of BinkleyTerm and all derivative works, with		*/
/*	   appropriate credit given to the author of the modification.			*/
/*																			*/
/*	   f) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of 		*/
/*	   transferring a copy, but no more than is necessary to recover		*/
/*	   your actual costs incurred in the transfer, and you may at your		*/
/*	   option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.				*/
/*																			*/
/* 3. Mere aggregation of another unrelated program with this program and	*/
/* documentation (or derivative works) on a volume of a storage or			*/
/* distribution medium does not bring the other program under the scope of	*/
/* these terms. 															*/
/*																			*/
/* 4. You may copy and distribute BinkleyTerm and its associated			*/
/* documentation (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in	*/
/* object code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 	*/
/* above provided that you also do one of the following:					*/
/*																			*/
/*	   a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable 	*/
/*	   source code, which must be distributed under the terms of			*/
/*	   Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,										*/
/*																			*/
/*	   b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three		*/
/*	   years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal			*/
/*	   shipping charge) a complete machine-readable copy of the 			*/
/*	   corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of		*/
/*	   Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,										*/
/*																			*/
/*	   c) accompany it with the information you received as to where		*/
/*	   the corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This				*/
/*	   alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and		*/
/*	   only if you received the program in object code or executable		*/
/*	   form alone.) 														*/
/*																			*/
/* For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code	*/
/* for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not	*/
/* include source code for modules which are standard libraries that		*/
/* accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs.		*/
/*																			*/
/* 5. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer BinkleyTerm and	*/
/* its associated documentation  except as expressly provided under this	*/
/* License Agreement.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, sublicense,			*/
/* distribute or transfer BinkleyTerm is void and your rights to use the	*/
/* program under this License agreement shall be automatically terminated.	*/
/* However, parties who have received computer software programs from you	*/
/* with this License Agreement will not have their licenses terminated so	*/
/* long as such parties remain in full compliance, and notify Bit Bucket	*/
/* Software Co. of their intention to comply with this Agreement.			*/
/*																			*/
/* 6. If you wish to incorporate parts of BinkleyTerm into other free		*/
/* programs whose distribution conditions are different, please contact 	*/
/* Bit Bucket Software Co. at one of the addresses listed below.  We have	*/
/* not yet worked out a simple rule that can be stated here, but we will	*/
/* usually permit this.  We will be guided by the two goals of preserving	*/
/* the free status of all derivatives of our free software (as it pertains	*/
/* to Non-Commercial use as provided by this Agreement) and of promoting	*/
/* the sharing and reuse of software.										*/
/*																			*/
/* 7. For the purposes of this document, "COMMERCIAL USE" is defined as 	*/
/* operation of the software on four or more computers or data lines owned	*/
/* by the same for-profit organization. Any organization may operate this	*/
/* software under the terms of this Non-Commercial Agreement if operation	*/
/* is limited to three or less computers or data lines. 					*/

/* WARRANTY.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, BIT BUCKET SOFTWARE	*/
